# frogger-clone
The gameplay is modeled after the classic arcade game Frogger. Use the arrow keys to move accross the board, while avoiding enemies. Capturing the star will give you 150 pts, but get hit and you will lose 300. Hitting the water will put you at the start, and will not subtract any points.
